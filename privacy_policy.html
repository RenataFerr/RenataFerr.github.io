									<h3 class="major">Hosting</h3>
									<p>Our hoster collects the following data transmitted by your browser in log files:</p>

									<p>IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request comes and information about the browser and operating system.</p>
									
									<p>This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
									
									<p>There is no tracking and we have no direct access to this data.</p>
									
									<p>We use the following hoster to provide our website:</p>
									
									<p>GitHub Inc.<br>
									88 Colin P Kelly Jr St<br>
									San Francisco, CA 94107<br>
									United States</p>
									
									<p>This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR in not having to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. Server location is USA.</p>
									
									<p>Further information on objection and removal options vis-à-vis GitHub can be found at: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages</p>
									
									<p>You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined as part of a balancing of interests.</p>
									
									<p>The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.</p>
									
									<p>The processing of the data specified in this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.</p>
									
									<p>GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of natural persons in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). Further information can be found at: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors</p>

									<h3 class="major">Legal Information</h3>
									
									<p>In principle, an order processing contract must be concluded with the hoster. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has made an exception for the hosting of purely static websites. If the website is used for self-presentation, e.g. by associations or small companies, no personal data flows to the operator and no tracking takes place, there is no order processing. It goes on to say: "The fact that IP addresses, i.e. personal data, must inevitably be processed even when hosting static websites does not lead to the assumption of order processing. That would not be appropriate. Rather, the (short-term) storage of IP addresses is still part of the website hoster's telecommunication access brokerage under the TKG and primarily serves the hoster's security purposes." (https://www.lda.bayern.de/media/veroeffentlichungen/FAQ_Hosting_keine_Auftragsverarbeitung.pdf) 
									  We assume that this exception applies to GitHub Pages.</p>
